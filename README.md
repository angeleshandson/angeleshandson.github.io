## Core Concepts

Productivity isn't just about doing more; it's about doing the right things in the best possible way. This repository is built on a few key concepts:

* **Effectiveness vs. Efficiency**: We focus on both getting tasks done (**effectiveness**) and doing them with minimal wasted effort (**efficiency**).
* **Resource Management**: Learn to manage not just your time, but also your energy and attention, which are your most valuable resources.
* **Habit Incubation**: This repo provides methods for building and maintaining positive habits that lead to long-term success.
* **Continuous Improvement**: Productivity is a journey, not a destination. We encourage an ongoing process of self-reflection and refinement of your strategies.

Whether you're looking to start a new habit, find a better way to manage your to-do list, or simply want to feel more in control of your work, this repository has something for you.
